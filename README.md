# **PyBer Analysis** :oncoming_automobile: :blue_car:

## Overview of Project:

The purpose of this project was to provide an analysis on total weekly fares per the city type for the company PyBer (a ride sharing company). This project would dive deep into showing how much customers are spending on PyBer's riding sharing service per week, based on their city type (Urban, Suburban, and Rural). Gain this type of insight and being able to present it visually, allows for upper managment to look over the numbers and decide if they need to add or take away a certain type of city. 

## Results: 

The image below clearly shows that the type of city that is spending the most of fares per week is the Urban city type. On the other end, we can see that Rural spends the least per week on ridesharing. In the middle is the Suburban city type. They dont spend the least but certainly not the most either. The graph indicates that Rural cities spend the least per week more than likely due to a shortage of drivers compaired to the urban cities. And, most rural communities, people own their own car and might not have a need to use ridesharing services.

        Total Rides	    Total Drivers	Total Fares	Average     Fare Per Ride	Average Fare Per Driver
Rural	    125	            78	            $4,327.93	            $34.62              $55.49
Suburban	625	            490	            $19,356.33	            $30.97	            $39.50
Urban	    1,625	        2,405	        $39,854.38	            $24.53	            $16.57

## Summary: 

There are a few things that i would suggest to Pyber based off the readings from the chart:

1. I would suggest taking a closer look at the rural data and really wrestle with the idea to keep servicing that area. It is clearly the lowest earning per week. 

2. If PyBer did want to keep servining the Rural market because they believed that the Rural market would expand and grow within the next few years, i would suggest to only offer the service during the spring/summer months. The reason for this is that we can see a decent increase in fare amount come April. This maybe because people are going to bars during the summer months and might need to use more ride share services. 

3. Finally, if PyBer wanted to stop serving the Rural community, i would suggest increasing fare amounts by a small margin for by the surburan and urban market to make up for the discontinuation  of the rural market.
